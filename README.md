### PROJECT INFORMATION
The Frequency Distribution Project involves implementing and comparing four different approaches in Java to determine the frequency distribution of objects in a list. The four approaches in this project are called Sequential strategy, SortedList strategy, Ordered strategy, and Map strategy. The project includes a script that generates a random list of objects and measures the time it takes to determine the frequency distribution using each approach. The goal is to compare the efficiency of each approach and determine which one is the most efficient for a given dataset.
